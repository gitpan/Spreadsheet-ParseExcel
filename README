NAME
    Spreadsheet::ParseExcel - Get information from Excel file

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to get information from Excel file.

    This module can handle files of Excel95, 97 and 2000.
    (and now supports Excel4)

    The module will work on the majority of Windows, UNIX and
    Macintosh platforms. 

REQUIREMENT
    This module requires these modules:
        OLE::Storage_Lite
        Jcode.pm    (if you are using FmtJapan, or FmtJapan2)
        Unicode::Map    (if you are using FmtJapan2 or FmtUnicode)
        IO::Scalar if PERLIO is not available
        Spreadsheet::WriteExcel (to use Spreadsheet::ParseExcel::SaveParser)

INSTALLATION
    The module can be installed using the standard Perl procedure:

        perl Build.PL
        ./Build
        ./Build test
        ./Bbuild install

        or

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install    # You may need to be root
        make clean      # or make realclean

        or using CPAN.pm or CPANPLUS.pm

    Windows users without a working "make" can get nmake from:
        ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

For FmtJapan2
  If you use FmtJapan2, you must do following actions:

  (1) Copy "CP932Excel.map" included with this distribution to an 
      applicatable directry.

  (2) To add "CP932Excel" as map name, append following lines to 
      REGISTRY in the Unicode::Map hierarchy 
      (changing map directy to applicatable directry):

name:    CP932Excel
srcURL:  $SrcUnicode/VENDORS/MICSFT/WINDOWS/CP932.TXT
src:     $DestUnicode/VENDORS/MICSFT/WINDOWS/CP932.TXT
map:     (which you copied directry)/CP932Excel.map
# Don't remove this line
