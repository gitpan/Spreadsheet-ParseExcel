DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to get information from Excel file.

    This module can handle files of Excel95, 97 and 2000.
    (and now supports Excel4)

    The module will work on the majority of Windows, UNIX and
    Macintosh platforms. 

REQUIREMENT
    This module requires these modules:
        OLE::Storage_Lite
        Jcode.pm      (if you are using FmtJapan, or FmtJapan2)
        Unicode::Map  (if you are using FmtJapan2 or FmtUnicode)
        IO::Scalar    (if PERLIO is not available)
        Spreadsheet::WriteExcel (to use Spreadsheet::ParseExcel::SaveParser)

INSTALLATION
    The module can be installed using the standard Perl procedure:

        perl Build.PL
        ./Build
        ./Build test
        ./Bbuild install

      or

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install    # You may need to be root
        make clean      # or make realclean

      or using CPAN.pm or CPANPLUS.pm

        cpan Spreadsheet::ParseExcel

    Windows users without a working "make" can get nmake from:
